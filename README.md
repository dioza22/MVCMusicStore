I'm new in .net development (ASP .NET MVC) and I found that it should be interesting to start by good tutorials.
So I've choosen this one (MVC Music Store) because there are many features that are exposed and that I'd like to understand myself and if possible push up the limite by adding some customization.

If you're a well know of this techno, I'd appreciate to have your opinion on this work.

Thanks folks :) !!
